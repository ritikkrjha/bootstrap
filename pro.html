<p style="color:white; font-size:24px;text-align:justify"> 
 The Pro Kabaddi League (PKL),is a professional-level kabaddi league in India. It was launched in 2014 and is broadcast on Star Sports.</p><br>

<img src="image/p.jpg" width="100%">

<br><br>
<p style="color:white; font-size:24px;text-align:justify"> The league's inception was influenced by the popularity of the kabaddi tournament at the 2006 Asian Games. The format of the competition was influenced by Indian Premier League. The Pro Kabaddi League uses a franchise-based model and its first season was held in 2014 with eight teams each of which having paid fees of up to US$250,000 to join.[2][3]
<br><br>
There were doubts over whether the PKL would be successful, noting that there were many leagues attempting to emulate the IPL's business model and success, and that unlike cricket, there were relatively fewer well-known players in Kabaddi. However, it was also noted that kabaddi was widely played in grassroots community settings, and could thus attract a wide variety of rural and metropolitan viewers for advertisers to target if the league gained significant traction.[2]
<br><br>
The inaugural season was seen by 435 million viewers, second to the 2014 Indian Premier League's 552 million, while the first season final between Jaipur Pink Panthers and U-Mumba was watched by 86.4 million.[4][5] Star Sports, the PKL's broadcaster,[6] subsequently announced in 2015 that it would acquire a 74% stake in the league's parent company Mashal Sports.[7]
<br><br>
For the 2017 and 2018-19 season, the PKL added four new teams, and changed its format to split the teams into two divisions known as "zones".[8] Soon the league returned to its regular double round-robin format for the 2019 season.</p>


<h1 style="color:red; text-align: center"><b>FORMAT</b></h1>

<br><br>
<p style="color:white; font-size:24px;text-align:justify">The PKL's rules are similar to that of the indoor team version of Kabaddi, but with additional rules to encourage more scoring. Playing two "empty" raids in a row will trigger a "do-or-die raid", where the raider must score a point or they will be declared out. When a defensive side has three or fewer players remaining, tackles are scored as a "Super Tackle", which is worth two points instead of one.</p>

<h1 style="color:red; text-align: center"><b>SEASONS</b></h1>

<p style="color:white; font-size:24px;text-align:justify"> Season 1<br><br>
The first signing and auction of players for the 8 teams was held on 20 May 2014[6] in Mumbai. India's national kabaddi captain Rakesh Kumar was the priciest among the players bought for ₹12.80 lakh by the Patna Pirates.[12] Sports Authority of India's Deepak Niwas Hooda was bought by Telugu Titans franchise for ₹12.60 lakh.[12] Tae Deok Eom was the highest paid overseas player bought for ₹7 lakh by Patna franchise.[12]
